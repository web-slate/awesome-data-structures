# 🚀 Absolutely Data Structures Information & Links

Fast growing AWESOME Data Structures Info. Nope, it's NOT a comprehensive list of

- It solves a real problem
- It does so in a 🦄 unique, 🦋 beautiful, or 🏆 exceptional way. (And it's not super popular and well-known... no point in listing those.)
- It has recent code commits!
